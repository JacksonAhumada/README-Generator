  ## Description
  I wanted to create a generator that made making a README easier and more streamlined. I wanted to be able to answer questions that were given in the terminal to help fill in the sections.

  ## Installation
  Node.js will need to be installed in order to run the code.

  ## Usage
  To use the application open a terminal in the root of the index.js file and run a node index.js command. Follow the prompts in the terminal to fill out the README file.

  ## Contribution
  Unknown
  
  ## Tests
  No test instructions.
